Google-Data-Analytics-project
As part of Google data analytics course, I had to choose a case study, I have completed:

Case Study 1

Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

In the project I will be using SQL for data joining, cleaning, wrangling and analysis. Then I used Tableau for visualization to enhance the analysis.

Background
In this scenario, I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. I am assigned to find out "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?" I need to provide three recommendations with data insight and visualization.
